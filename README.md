# Facial Detection Project

## Overview

This project implements a **Facial Detection System** using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). The system detects faces in images or video streams and can be integrated with additional features such as facial recognition or emotion detection.

## Features

- **Face detection:** Detects faces in both static images and live video streams.
- **Real-time processing:** Efficiently processes frames from video inputs.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable to include more features like facial recognition or object tracking.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
  
You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
