Facial Detection Project
Overview
This project implements a Facial Detection System using OpenCV and Python. The system detects faces in images or video streams and can be integrated with additional features such as facial recognition or emotion detection.

Features
Face detection: Detects faces in both static images and live video streams.
Real-time processing: Efficiently processes frames from video inputs.
Customizable: Easily extendable to include more features like facial recognition or object tracking.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-detection.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd facial-detection
Open the Jupyter Notebook (Facial-Detection.ipynb) to explore the code and run the facial detection model:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Facial-Detection.ipynb
Usage
To use the face detection system:

Static image detection: Run the notebook cells for image input to detect faces in static images.
Live video detection: Use the video stream option to detect faces in real-time via a webcam or a video file.
Examples
Here's an example of face detection on a sample image:


Future Work
Adding emotion detection and recognition.
Improving accuracy with deep learning models.
Building a web-based interface for easy access.
